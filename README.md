# Calendar

A class project scripted in Racket which creates a customizable calendar completely from scratch. 

My code allows you to select any day of any year using input keys and will tell you which day of the week any day falls on. 

It also allows you to input your own events along with their start times and end times. 

To run this code: 
  1) Open DrRacket
  2) Open project3.rkt
  3) Press run in the top right corner 
  4) Type in the command line "(run <calendar format> <month> <year>)"
  
An example: "(run fmt0 2 2023)" 

There are two formats to choose from "fmt0" and "fmt1" 

A calendar will be created which will automatically place you at the first day of that month and year. 

A demo of my code is provided below with the cmd line input "(run fmt0 2 2023)":
