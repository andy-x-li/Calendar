# Custom Calendar

A project I scripted from scratch in Racket which creates a customizable calendar. 

My code allows you to select any day of any year and will calculate which day of the week that day falls on. 

It also allows you to input your own calendar events along with their start times and end times. 

To run this code: <br>
> **1)** Open DrRacket <br>
  **2)** Open `project3.rkt` <br>
  **3)** Press run in the top right corner <br>
  **4)** Type in the command line `(run [calendarformat] [month] [year])` <br>
  > An example: `(run fmt0 2 2023)` 

There are two formats to choose from "fmt0" and "fmt1" 

A calendar will be created which will automatically place you at the first day of that month and year. 

A demo of my code is provided below with the cmd line input `(run fmt0 2 2023)`:

**Note**: 
  *`project1.rkt` and `project2.rkt` are different stages of my code. `project3.rkt` is the final version.*
